# React Interactive Login

An Interactive Login with basic form validation and an avatar animated when the user interacts with the form. 

## Technologies usage
This project uses React and styled-components. 

It offers a custom react hook (useForm) as an easy way of form validation. This useForm hook can be used in form with different fields, since it needs the fields values as its first argument.
